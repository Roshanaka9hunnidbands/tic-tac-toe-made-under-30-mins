# Tic Tac Toe Game with Pygame

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using the Pygame library in Python. The game was created as a challenge to build a functional version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game within a 30-minute time frame.

## Installation

Before running the game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the Pygame library, which can be installed via pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

## Features

- **Pygame Implementation**: Developed using Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python.
- **Simple Interface**: Designed with a straightforward user interface and easy-to-understand gameplay.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- **Automatic Win Detection**: The game automatically detects winning combinations and declares the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: In case of a draw, the game notifies both players accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Running the Game**: Execute the Python script (`tic_tac_toe.py`) to start the game.
2. **Gameplay**: Two players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
3. **Win Detection**: The game automatically identifies winning combinations or a draw.
4. **Restarting the Game**: Players can restart the game by closing the window and running the script again.

## Note

This project was developed within a limited time frame as a challenge to create a simple and functional Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame. It serves as a demonstration of basic game development concepts and Python programming skills. You're welcome to explore the code and make modifications as desired!
